Religion and scientific beliefs constitute different ways of seeing the world. Science emphasizes scientific methodology and empirical evidence in understanding the environment. Therefore, religion usually relies on religious teachings and spiritual beliefs. If understood wisely, the two can coexist, even though they are different. Religion provides an understanding of the meaning and value of life, while science provides an understanding of the real world. In order to achieve harmony, it is important that we recognize these differences. This allows people to respect each other and allows for a discussion between scientific and spiritual beliefs.
